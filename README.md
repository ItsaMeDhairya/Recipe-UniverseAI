AI Recipe Universe - Python Edition

Welcome to the AI Recipe Universe, a powerful command-line recipe assistant built entirely in Python and powered by Google APIs.

This application allows you to generate new recipes, modify them with AI, find ingredient swaps, get beverage pairings, search the web for inspiration, and save everything to a local digital cookbook.

Setup Instructions

Follow these steps carefully to get the application running.
Step 1: Prerequisites

    Python 3.7 or newer.

    pip (Python's package installer).

Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Step 3: Get Your Google API Key & Search Engine IDs

This project runs entirely on Google APIs. You need to set up a single Google Cloud project to get the keys.

    Create a Google Cloud Project:

        Go to the Google Cloud Console.

        Create a new project (e.g., "AI-Recipe-Project").

    Enable APIs:

        In your new project, go to the "APIs & Services" > "Library".

        Find and enable the following two APIs:

            Vertex AI API (this is for the Gemini model)

            Custom Search API

    Create an API Key:

        Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".

        Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "API key".

        Copy your newly created API key. Keep this key private.

    Create Two Programmable Search Engines:

        Go to the Programmable Search Engine control panel.

        Create the first engine for Web Search:

            Click "Add".

            Name it something like "RecipeWebSearch".

            Enable the option to "Search the entire web".

            After creation, go to its "Control Panel" > "Basics" and copy the Search engine ID.

        Create the second engine for Image Search:

            Click "Add" again.

            Name it something like "RecipeImageSearch".

            Enable "Image search" and "Search the entire web".

            After creation, go to its "Control Panel" > "Basics" and copy this Search engine ID as well.

Step 4: Configure the Application

Create a new file named config.py in the same directory as the other project files. Copy and paste the following content into it, filling in the keys you obtained in the previous step.

# config.py
# Paste your secret keys and IDs here.

# Your main Google Cloud API Key
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"

# The ID for your web search engine
CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_WEB = "PASTE_YOUR_WEB_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE"

# The ID for your image search engine
CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_IMAGE = "PASTE_YOUR_IMAGE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE"


Step 5: Run the Application

You're all set! Open your terminal in the project directory and run the main script:

python main.py


Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate the application. Enjoy your AI-powered culinary adventure!
Uploading to GitHub (Important Security Note)

If you plan to upload this project to a public GitHub repository, you MUST prevent your secret API keys from being published. The config.py file should NEVER be committed to Git.

This project includes a .gitignore file that is pre-configured to ignore config.py and other common Python files. Ensure this file is present before you create your first commit.
