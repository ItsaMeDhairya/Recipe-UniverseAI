Mix well and let it marinate for at least 1 hour, or preferably 3-4 hours in the refrigerator.",

Add thinly sliced onions and fry on medium-low heat until deep golden brown and crispy. This will take about 20-25 minutes. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for garnishing.",
                    "Cook the chicken base: In the same pot with the remaining fried onions and oil, add bay leaves, cinnamon stick, green cardamom, and cloves. Saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned and the masala starts to release oil (about 15-20 minutes).",
                    "Par-cook the rice: While the chicken is cooking, drain the soaked Basmati rice. In a large pot, bring plenty of water to a rolling boil. Add salt. Add the drained Basmati rice and cook until it's about 70-80% done (the grains should be slightly firm but not hard). This usually takes 5-7 minutes. Drain the rice immediately.",
                    "Layer the Biryani: Layer half of the par-cooked rice over the chicken in the pot. Sprinkle with some of the remaining chopped mint and coriander leaves, and some of the reserved fried onions. Drizzle with half of the saffron milk.",
                    "Add the second layer: Layer the remaining par-cooked rice over the first rice layer. Again, sprinkle with the rest of the chopped mint and coriander leaves, and the remaining reserved fried onions. Drizzle with the rest of the saffron milk.",
                    "Dum cook: Cover the pot tightly with a lid. You can seal the edges with dough or foil to prevent steam from escaping (optional). Cook on very low heat for 20-25 minutes. This 'dum' cooking allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking perfectly with the steam.",
                    "Rest and Serve: Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10-15 minutes without opening the lid. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing the layers. Serve hot with raita and salad."
